# Raymarched Space Effects

Treat these effects as numerical renderers with explicit integration state. The visual character depends on coordinate choice, step policy, and how rays interact with emissive structures.

## Workflow

1. Define the effect-space transform and camera ray.
2. Choose a physical, physically inspired, or purely artistic bending model.
3. Bound the integration domain.
4. Track ray position, direction, throughput, and accumulated radiance.
5. Detect crossings with disks, shells, throats, or event boundaries.
6. Sample the background only after integration terminates.
7. Add diagnostics for trajectory, step count, and termination reason.

Read [references/curved-ray-integrators.md](references/curved-ray-integrators.md)
for the RK4 wormhole, artistic curved-ray accretion integrator, disk
composition, and implementation defects.

Read the
[curved-ray accretion volume](examples/curved-ray-accretion-volume/curved-ray-effect.js)
for the inverse-square steering loop, thin disk density, front-to-back
accumulation, deterministic star environment, and integrator diagnostics.

Read the
[Schwarzschild geodesic black-hole effect](examples/schwarzschild-geodesic-black-hole/geodesic-black-hole-effect.js)
for RK2 null-geodesic integration, interpolated equatorial disk crossings,
Doppler/redshift disk emission, lensed procedural deep field, and HDR bloom
composition.

## Constraints

- Do not call a UV swirl “gravitational lensing.”
- Cap iterations and provide early termination.
- Use continuous crossing tests for thin structures.
- Keep numerical stability independent from frame rate.
- Separate the integrator from shading of the accretion disk or wormhole interior.
- Provide a cheaper approximation for non-hero views.

## Routing boundary

Use `$threejs-procedural-vfx` for ordinary particles, trails, plasma, and event
effects. This skill is for per-pixel numerical ray integration through curved
or bounded space-effect domains.
