# Curved-ray numerical integrators

Use this reference for an RK4 wormhole integrator and an artistic inverse-square curved-ray accretion volume, including state reduction, disk accumulation, background lensing, and numerical diagnostics. For metric-derived Schwarzschild null-geodesic integration with interpolated disk crossings and Doppler-shifted emission, read the `schwarzschild-geodesic-black-hole` example directly.

## Wormhole state reduction

The wormhole renderer uses a spherically symmetric throat model. It reduces
each 3D ray to a two-dimensional integration state:

```text
y.x = signed radial coordinate l
y.y = radial momentum pL
impact parameter b = length(cross(rayOrigin, rayDirection))
throat radius Rth = 1.2
```

It constructs an orbital plane:

```text
normal = normalize(cross(origin, direction))
u = normalize(origin)
v = cross(normal, u)
```

Near-radial rays use fallback axes to avoid a zero cross product.

Initial signed coordinate:

```text
l = sqrt(max(length(origin)^2 - Rth^2, 0.001))
pL = dot(normalize(origin), direction)
```

## Wormhole RK4 integration

The derivative is:

```text
r2 = l^2 + Rth^2
dl/ds = r2 * pL
dpL/ds = b^2 * l / r2
```

The shader runs fourth-order Runge–Kutta with:

```text
maximum iterations = 920
base step = 0.0042
per-ray step jitter = +/- 0.00045
escape distance = abs(l) > 40
azimuth accumulation = step * b
```

On escape:

```text
finalDirection =
  normalize(u * cos(phi) + v * sin(phi))
```

The sign of final `l` selects which exterior universe is visible. Failure to
escape renders a bright fallback color, making iteration-cap pixels observable.

This is materially stronger than a UV swirl because the final environment
direction comes from numerical integration.

## Universe selection

The two exterior universes are independent procedural directional fields. Both
use five-octave FBM, animated coordinate drift, broad/fine structure, and
different plane orientation.

Sample those fields only after integration. Lensing must change the lookup
direction rather than distort an already rendered screen image.

A small direction-hashed grain of amplitude `0.01` reduces visible gradient
banding.

## Accretion-volume integration

The `curved-ray-accretion-volume` example is evaluated on a sphere surrounding
the effect. Defaults:

```text
iterations = 128
step = 0.0071
ray jitter = 0.01
bending power = 0.3
core radius = 0.13
disk half-width = 0.03
```

Per step:

```text
r = length(rayPosition)
steerMagnitude = step * power / r^2
steerRange = remapClamped(r, 1 -> 0.5, 0 -> 1)
newDirection = normalize(direction - radial * steerMagnitude * steerRange)
```

The ray direction is bent toward the center only inside the configured range.
Unlike the wormhole, this is an artistic inverse-square steering field, not a
validated metric geodesic.

## Disk density and color

Disk coordinates rotate around the local Z axis with radius and time:

```text
rotation phase = radialDistance * 4.27 - time * 0.1
noise UV = rotatedPosition * 2
```

A repeated deep-noise texture is multiplied by a quadratic band across
`[-width, 0, +width]`. Radial distance, noise value, and a nearby noise sample
produce a ramp coordinate.

The three-point color ramp is:

```text
white-hot at 0.06
gold at 0.33
dark amber at 1.0
emission scale 1.95
additional emission color (1.0, 0.72, 0.26)
```

The central sphere below `originRadius` is black. Disk opacity accumulates
front-to-back into `alphaAcc`; color accumulates using remaining transmittance.

## Background lensing

After the fixed loop, the final bent direction samples a deterministic
equirectangular star texture generated from `5200` seeded stars on a sphere.

```text
final = accumulated disk color
      + remaining transmittance * star environment
```

The deterministic star field is important: lensing motion can be compared
without random stars moving between runs.

## Observed defects and boundaries

- The demonstrated accretion-volume loop advances `rayPosition` twice per
  iteration while its steering magnitude uses a single `step`. Treat the
  effective distance step as `2 * step`, or remove the duplicate advance and
  retune the complete density-and-bending system explicitly.
- The accretion volume has no early exit and no termination IDs; every pixel
  pays the full iteration count.
- Its disk is detected by local band density at samples, not by a continuous
  plane-crossing test. A large step can skip a thin disk.
- The artistic inverse-square steering must not be described as general
  relativity.
- The wormhole uses a fixed high iteration cap and per-ray step jitter but has
  no CPU reference-ray tests.
- Both effects render on bounded proxy geometry; coordinate transforms must be
  verified if the proxy is nonuniformly scaled or moved far from the origin.
- The star texture is finite-resolution and can alias under extreme
  magnification.

## Diagnostics

Expose:

```text
wormhole l and pL
impact parameter and orbital-plane basis
RK4 step count and escaped/capped state
final exterior side and environment direction
accretion-volume radius and steering magnitude
effective traveled distance
disk band, noise, ramp coordinate, and local alpha
accumulated alpha and remaining transmittance
core-hit mask
final bent background direction
NaN/invalid-state mask
```

Add CPU reference rays for the wormhole before claiming physical parity, and a
continuous disk-crossing variant before increasing the accretion volume’s step
size.
