Use for complete hard-surface object assemblies, tilted shell lofts, UV-owned apertures, sculpted rail and frame profiles, oriented branch rings, semantic mesh writers, deliberate skins and caps, fin lofts, custom normals, material slots, instancing decisions, and close-inspection geometry budgets.

# Procedural Geometry

Generate geometry from a semantic plan and an explicit coordinate frame. Triangle emission is the final compilation step, not the design model.

## Build order

1. Define dimensions and semantic segments.
2. Generate a centerline, boundary, profile, or placement plan.
3. Build the mechanism-appropriate local parameterization or branch orientation.
4. Emit vertices with intentional seams and material ownership.
5. Generate UVs from real distance.
6. Validate winding, normals, tangents, bounds, and degenerates.
7. Select merging, instancing, or LOD by update and material behavior.

Read [references/profile-sweeps-and-mesh-writers.md](references/profile-sweeps-and-mesh-writers.md)
for the exact sculpted-frame profile, rail emission, tree rings, semantic mesh
writer, and their observed scaling limits.

Read the
[sculpted gallery frame geometry](examples/sculpted-gallery-frame/frame-geometry.js)
for the profile sweep, miter-like rail mapping, authored PBR surface
bundles, grazing spotlights, selective bloom ownership, and geometry
diagnostics.

Read
[references/complete-submarine-assembly.md](references/complete-submarine-assembly.md)
for the exact dimensioned object contract, shared loft/sweep kernel, UV-owned
apertures, semantic subassemblies, generated fittings, and complete-model
diagnostics.

parallel-transport trim, furnished glass cabin, shrouded propeller, lens-section
fins, generated material inputs, and per-part triangle evidence.

volumes, spanwise airfoil lofts, warped outline plates, the two-plane paint
projector, load-deflected tyre carcasses, and their measured limits.

for one continuous nose-to-engine-cover loft driven by monotone parameter
tracks, a cockpit recess opened inside the section itself, superellipse sidepods
with a real inlet aperture, spanwise wing lofts, the livery projector, and a
contact-deflected tyre.

shells, spoked wheels with a rotor alpha mask, a hanging chain path, and a
volume-audited assembly.

scale.

## Failure conditions

- profile orientation flips along a curve;
- caps reuse side vertices and create averaged edge normals;
- UV scale changes with segment count;
- arbitrary vertex merging destroys hard edges or material boundaries;
- generated dimensions are hidden in magic multipliers;
- instancing is used despite per-instance topology differences;
- triangle count is the only reported complexity metric;
- apertures, frames, and glazing use unrelated coordinate systems;
- complete object parts are positioned by late visual nudges instead of a
  shared dimension contract;
- a closed body ships inside-out because winding was never audited — check the
  enclosed signed volume, since a wireframe pass cannot see it;
- a section track uses per-segment easing, so every knot has zero slope and the
  lofted surface terraces under grazing light;
- a projected surface graphic is blended between planes without normalising the
  weights, printing the same graphic twice on a 45-degree shoulder.

## Routing boundary

This skill owns reusable mesh emission. Use
`$threejs-procedural-materials` when surface identity is primary,
`$threejs-procedural-architecture` for a building grammar, and
`$threejs-procedural-vegetation` for a growth hierarchy; those subject skills
may then apply these geometry mechanisms.
