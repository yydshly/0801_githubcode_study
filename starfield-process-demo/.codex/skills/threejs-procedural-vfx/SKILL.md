# Procedural VFX

Build effects from an event envelope, motion field, geometry representation, and shading response. Avoid independent particle emitters that happen to share a color.

## Effect graph

```text
subject/event state
  → effect-specific geometry, voxel fields, or instance attributes
  → flow-facing masks or analytic age
  → material response
  → pool/lifetime ownership
  → HDR and bloom contribution
```

Read [references/procedural-vfx-system.md](references/procedural-vfx-system.md)
for ship-conforming reentry shells, capsule wakes, dense instanced
spark/debris pools, holographic projection shells, HDR hierarchy, and
implementation limits.

Read [references/volumetric-fluid-fire.md](references/volumetric-fluid-fire.md)
for three-dimensional texture ownership, fixed fluid-compute scheduling,
mesh-surface injection, pressure projection, moving SDF boundaries,
temperature-mapped HDR raymarching, exact presets, and failure diagnostics.

Read [references/volumetric-aurora-curtains.md](references/volumetric-aurora-curtains.md)
for finite emissive-slab bounds, warped curtain density, uniform ray steps,
gentle start jitter, matching screen/probe materials, exact constants, limits,
and failure diagnostics.

Read the [reentry plasma implementation](examples/reentry-plasma/reentry-plasma.js)
for closed layered wake shells, flow-axis deformation, advected filament
fields, opacity shaping, and additive emission diagnostics.

Read the
[hologram projection material](examples/holographic-shape-transition/hologram-material.js)
for the additive rim shell itself: squared Fresnel incidence with grazing
falloff, footprint-filtered object-space scanlines, height-phased glitch
displacement, and index-gated participation. Read its
[shape-transition driver](examples/holographic-shape-transition/hologram-transition.js)
for the shared sweep range across a shape set, the linear progress ramp inside a
longer dwell, and the complementary-discard handover.

Read the
[volumetric fluid fire implementation](examples/volumetric-fluid-fire/volumetric-fluid-fire.js)
for the complete WebGPU/TSL velocity, dye, pressure, vorticity, emitter,
collision, raymarch, and diagnostic system plus its calibrated fire preset.

Read the
[raymarched aurora implementation](examples/raymarched-aurora-curtains/aurora-curtains.js)
for the reusable emitting field, perspective-ray material, four-sample
equirectangular radiance material, shared uniforms, and calibrated curtain
preset without sky, terrain, weather, lighting, or renderer setup.

## Rules

- Every layer must have a role in silhouette, motion, illumination, or residue.
- Give velocity, dye, pressure, vorticity, and collisions explicit texture
  ownership and one fixed compute schedule.
- For low-angle aurora, use a finite shallow emitting footprint, uniform ray
  steps, gentle start jitter, and step-length-weighted accumulation. Do not add
  extinction or an elevation gate after the footprint already removes the long
  limb path.
- Keep aurora emission separable from sky, stars, atmosphere, terrain lighting,
  weather, and grading; expose the same radiance through perspective and
  equirectangular materials.
- Convert velocity to volume UVW with the world-size vector; never advect a
  non-cubic volume as though its axes had equal scale.
- Keep the pressure ping-pong endpoint consistent with the projection read.
- Use normalized lifetime curves instead of scattered time constants.
- Derive secondary motion from the same flow or event direction.
- Keep bloom as a response to HDR emission, not as the effect's only shape.
- Pool instances and trails; do not allocate per burst.
- Filter every periodic band by pixel footprint, and fade it to the band's own
  mean rather than to zero.
- Measure rim incidence in a frame built from an inverse-transpose normal matrix.
- Give a multi-shape transition one shared normalised range and complementary
  discards, never per-shape ranges or overlapping coverage.
- Expose spawn, simulation, overdraw, and luminance debug views.
- Include a non-bloom baseline that remains legible.

## Routing boundary

Use `$threejs-temporal-surfaces` only for the screen-space
frost/touch-history pipeline. Use `$threejs-precipitation-surfaces` for
falling rain or snow, splash flipbooks, and weather events that alter ground
materials. Use `$threejs-volumetric-clouds` for atmospheric weather layers and
planet-scale cloud volumes. Use `$threejs-atmosphere-aerial-perspective` for
molecular/aerosol sky scattering and surface-segment aerial perspective. Keep
emissive aurora curtain volumes, bounded interactive fire and smoke,
subject-space plasma, generated wakes, sparks, pooled debris, and additive
projection shells in this skill.
