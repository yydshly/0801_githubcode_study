# Three.js Visual Skill Router

Treat the model's Three.js knowledge and official documentation as prerequisites. Load only the expertise that changes the visual result.

## Execution order

For a new procedural scene:

1. Define a visual contract: subject, scale, camera distance, motion, and target frame budget.
2. Load `$threejs-camera-direction` when framing, lens, camera frame, or mode transitions affect the target.
3. Load the subject-generation skill.
4. Add `$threejs-procedural-animation` when object motion requires authored phases, moving frames, or spring convergence.
5. Add `$threejs-procedural-fields` when multiple visual channels must share coherent structure.
6. Add lighting/shadows and atmosphere only after silhouette and material masks read without effects.
7. Add `$threejs-image-pipeline` last.
8. Load only the atomic image effects actually needed.
9. Use `$threejs-visual-validation` for a deterministic evidence set.

## Routing constraints

- Do not load a skill for API setup alone. Inspect the installed Three.js version and use official docs.
- Do not route “make it beautiful” directly to post-processing. Find the missing authored system.
- Prefer one strong, inspectable visual rule over several independent noise layers.
- When adapting a supplied reference, preserve the mechanism that creates its character. Do not reduce it to a generic effect category.
- Keep object-space, world-space, and screen-space systems separate unless the composition explicitly requires coupling.
- If no retained skill matches, state that the pack lacks expert coverage for that system. Do not stretch the nearest skill to cover it.

## Acceptance gate

A routed task is incomplete until the implementation exposes:

- deterministic seed or reproducible inputs;
- visual debug modes for its controlling fields;
- parameters grouped by perceptual role;
- an intentional mechanism-backed quality or resolution tier when the system defines one;
- a no-post baseline that still reads.
