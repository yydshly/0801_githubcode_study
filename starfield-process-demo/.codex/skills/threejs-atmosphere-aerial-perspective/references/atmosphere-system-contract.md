## Shared parameter model

The LUT path — the `lut-aerial-perspective` example — keeps one atmosphere
object for sky and aerial perspective. Earth-like defaults:

```text
solar irradiance = (1.474, 1.8504, 1.91198)
sun angular radius = 0.004675 rad
bottom radius = 6,360,000 m
top radius = 6,420,000 m
Rayleigh scattering = (0.005802, 0.013558, 0.0331)
Mie scattering = (0.003996, 0.003996, 0.003996)
Mie extinction = (0.00444, 0.00444, 0.00444)
Mie phase g = 0.8
absorption extinction = (0.00065, 0.001881, 0.000085)
ground albedo = 0.1
```

Density profiles are two-layer functions:

```text
density(h) =
  clamp(
    expTerm * exp(expScale * h)
    + linearTerm * h
    + constantTerm,
    0,
    1
  )
```

The default Rayleigh exponential scale is `-0.125`, Mie `-0.833333`.
Absorption uses two linear layers centered around the ozone region rather than
another ground-heavy exponential.

One explicit meter-to-render-unit conversion is applied when parameters become
uniforms. Preserve this single conversion boundary.

## LUT atmosphere contract

The sky material and aerial-perspective effect consume the same:

```text
transmittance texture
scattering 3D texture
irradiance texture
optional single-Mie and higher-order scattering textures
atmosphere parameters
sun direction
```

The sky material reconstructs rays from inverse projection and inverse view
matrices. It can render sun, moon, ground, and shadow-length integration.

The aerial-perspective effect owns:

```text
camera projection/view and inverses
camera world position
depth
optional normal buffer
ellipsoid radii
world-to-ECEF transform
altitude correction
geometric-error correction
overlay/cloud shadow/light-mask inputs
```

Default composition enables segment transmittance and inscatter. Direct sun
light and sky-light relighting are separate switches. Do not collapse these
signals into one fog color.

## Ellipsoid and depth ownership

The geospatial path defaults to `Ellipsoid.WGS84` and can correct both
camera altitude and geometry error. Atmosphere altitude is therefore not
`worldPosition.y`.

Required coordinate contract:

```text
world position
  -> world-to-ECEF
  -> ellipsoid-relative position
  -> corrected altitude
  -> LUT coordinates / segment scattering
```

The aerial effect declares depth ownership through its post-processing effect
attribute. It also supports octahedral normals or normal reconstruction when
lighting terms require orientation.

## Dynamic-integration body profiles

The dynamic per-body path derives profiles by body kind and density.
Terrestrial baseline:

```text
Rayleigh = (0.0058, 0.0135, 0.0331)
Mie scattering = (0.0022, 0.0022, 0.0022)
Mie extinction = (0.0032, 0.0032, 0.0032)
Rayleigh scale height = lerp(7.2, 10.8, normalized density) km
Mie scale height = lerp(0.9, 1.7, normalized density) km
Mie g = 0.76
ozone extinction = (0.00065, 0.001881, 0.000085)
solar intensity = 13.8
```

Rocky bodies reduce scattering and remove ozone. Gas/ice giants use much
larger scale heights and `g` around `0.80–0.82`.

The implementation enforces:

```text
mieExtinction[channel] >= mieScattering[channel] + 0.0001
g <= 0.92
```

This prevents negative absorption and unstable phase behavior.

## Dynamic integration

For each camera ray, the dynamic path:

1. intersects the top atmosphere sphere;
2. clamps the segment against the surface sphere;
3. marches `ATMOSPHERE_VIEW_SAMPLES`;
4. accumulates Rayleigh, Mie, and triangular ozone depth;
5. at every view sample, marches a sun segment with
   `ATMOSPHERE_LIGHT_SAMPLES`;
6. tests planet occlusion of the sun;
7. evaluates Rayleigh and anisotropic Mie phase;
8. returns in-scattered radiance and view transmittance.

It adds an upper-Rayleigh exponential term and fades density over the final
`24%` of atmosphere thickness to soften the shell edge.

The compact path includes a small multiple-scattering approximation derived
from `1 - transmittance`; it is not equivalent to the precomputed higher-order
scattering available in the LUT path.

## Shell/post handoff

The dynamic path renders a double-sided shell and a depth-aware post path from
one profile. Runtime face-opacity weights avoid a hard front/back cull switch.

The post blend is based on altitude above the atmosphere top:

```text
entry blend near = 140 km
entry blend far = max(448 km, visual atmosphere height * 0.58)
post blend = 1 - smoothstep(near, far, altitudeFromTop)
```

The post path applies only where scene depth represents a surface. The shell
continues to own sky pixels and limb appearance.

Preserve:

```text
one body center and radius
one atmosphere profile
one sun direction
one unit conversion
surface-depth classification
continuous shell/post blend
```

## Implementation limits

- The dynamic path performs nested integration and is expensive compared with
  LUT lookup.
- Its atmosphere uses spheres, while the LUT example supports an ellipsoid
  and ECEF correction.
- The dynamic path’s multiple-scattering term is an artistic approximation.
- The LUT architecture is version-sensitive and built around its own
  post-processing/coordinate utilities; adapt the architecture, not imports
  blindly.
- Do not combine LUT radiance and dynamic integrated radiance at full weight.
  Choose ownership or a validated transition.

## Diagnostics

Expose:

```text
planet/ECEF coordinates and corrected altitude
top and bottom intersections
Rayleigh, Mie, and absorption density

sky versus surface depth classification
shell front/back opacity
post blend
LUT coordinates and texture slices
```
